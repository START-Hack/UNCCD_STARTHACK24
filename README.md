# <p align="center"> A Land of Opportunities: Tackling Wildfire Land Degradation in Brazil with the G20 Global Land Initiative and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya · BarcelonaTech (UPC) </p>

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>

### Who are we?

**The G20 Global Land Initiative**

The G20 Global Land Initiative at the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification was launched during the Saudi Arabia G20 Presidency, and it has as ambition to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in degraded land worldwide by 2040. To inspire all stakeholders to collectively deliver on land conservation and restoration outcomes: we showcase success stories; engage the private sector; empower civil society and the public; and share knowledge to build capacity among G20 members as well as interested non-member countries and other stakeholders. 

**The Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)**

The Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, also known as BarcelonaTech, is a pioneering institution in the field of engineering and architectural studies. It has always been at the forefront of academic excellence and innovation, offering a range of programs that encourage creative and critical thinking among students and researchers. UPC collaborates with international initiatives like the G20 Global Land Initiative to provide data and expertise that support global sustainability efforts.

### The Problem

The challenge we face as the G20 Global Land Initiative is to raise awareness on the importance of halting land degradation and incentivise investment for land restoration.
We expect our Hack Teams to pitch their final product to a panel jury representing members of the government of Brazil and provide a comprehensive visualization product/solution that presents the problem and incentivises for solutions.

In a world where wildfires devastate our landscapes, the battle against land degradation is more critical than ever. The G20 Global Land Initiative stands at the forefront of this battle. We've partnered with the BarcelonaTech University, who provided us with valuable data to tackle this issue.
Today we want to take you on a journey with us to Brazil. This year, Brazil holds the G20 Presidency and we have a unique opportunity to collaborate with the Brazilian government in addressing one of their biggest causes for land degradation: wildfires. Extensive wildfire in Brazil leading to widespred land degradation, severely impacting various ecosystems and populations.

Brazil is home to six major biomes, each with its own unique features and biodiversity. These biomes cover a whopping 20 percent of the Earth's natural species. The Amazon, known for its tropical forests and meadows, often takes the spotlight. But Brazil's other biomes like the Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and the Pampa are equally important. The Cerrado's savanna vegetation supports agriculture, while the Caatinga thrives in fruits and medicinal herbs despite being a semi-arid region. The Pantanal, shaped by rivers, is home to rare flora and fauna. The Pampa integrates the herbaceous Araucária species forests, and the Atlantic Forest exhibits varied climates and ecosystems along its coastlines.
Despite their richness, these biomes face significant challenges. Land degradation, caused by forest fires, is an urgent matter that needs immediate attention. These wildfires not only destroy precious ecosystems but also exacerbate land degradation, leading to a cascade of environmental impacts. From soil erosion and habitat destruction to invasive plant species, floods, desertification, air pollution, and water scarcity, the consequences are profound and far-reaching.
We've gathered datasets and resources to guide you in developing innovative solutions in locating active wildfires and showcase your results. you must raise awareness on the impact of wildfires to the Government of Brazil. Whether you're tech-savvy or not, you'll have the opportunity to contribute and pitch your ideas to the Brazilian Government. Get ready to use cutting-edge technology and diverse skills to revolutionize wildfire detection and land restoration.

## <p align="center"> Hackathon Challenges: </p> 

In order to encourage innovation and skill enhancement among participating teams, the hackathon is structured in 3 phases:

### First Task: Wildfire Identification Challenge

The inaugural task is centered around the critical challenge of wildfire identification. Each participating team will be equipped with a foundational deep learning model, specifically the **EfficientNetB0**, pre-trained to classify instances of forest fires from a curated dataset dedicated to wildfire detection. This model serves not only as a preliminary tool but also as a standard benchmark to ensure equitable comparison across all entries. Teams are encouraged to enhance this model's accuracy and efficiency by innovating on its architecture or methodologies. Alternatively, should teams choose to develop a model from the ground up, it is imperative to utilize EfficientNetB0 as the baseline framework. This approach guarantees a level playing field, facilitating a fair and objective assessment of each team's inventive solutions tailored to this pressing environmental concern.

#### Stage One: Initial Model Evaluation

- Teams are first tasked with downloading and deploying the provided baseline **EfficientNetB0 model** to evaluate its performance on the test wildfire dataset.
- Completing this initial evaluation secures a foundational score of **3 points** for each team, acknowledging their competence in working with the provided deep learning model.

#### Stage Two: Model Improvement

- The crux of the challenge lies in the subsequent improvement of the wildfire detection model.
- Teams are encouraged to refine and augment the baseline model, aiming for substantial advancements in its predictive accuracy.
- The enhanced models will undergo rigorous testing against a concealed wildfire dataset from Brazil.
- The percentage of improvement over the baseline model, as gauged on this hidden dataset, will be the yardstick for success in this stage.
- This improvement percentage, when compared against the enhancements achieved by other teams, will be scaled up and reflected in the final score, with the potential to earn up to an additional **5 points**.
- The final tally will be derived by multiplying the relative percentage improvement by 5, thus incentivizing breakthrough innovations in wildfire detection technology.

**Deadline for Submission**: All submissions for Task 1 must be finalized and submitted by no later than **9 PM on the 21st of March** via an email to Ismail El madafri <ismail.el.madafri@upc.edu> with the link to the repository.
